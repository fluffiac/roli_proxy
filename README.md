# `e.roli.ga` Proxy Reimplementation

`e.roli.ga` is an e926 proxy server that acts as a middleman between a 
VRChat client and the e926 image board. Its design is oriented around the
specific limitations of the VRChat world scripting API. The VRChat world
is able to deliver the expirience of browsing the image board through the 
proxy. This project reimplements the proxy and provides a way to direct
requests to my backend instead of the one hosted by the world author.
