# e621 Search World Jailbreak

The "e621 Search World" is a VRChat world that acts like a browser for the 
e926 image board. It works by connecting to a website hosted by the world 
author, `e.roli.ga`, which is necessary for formatting data into the way that
VRChat wants. This repository contains a re-implementation of the `e.roli.ga` 
site, and instructions for re-directing requests sent to `e.roli.ga` to the
site that I am hosting, a jailbroken version. `:3`
