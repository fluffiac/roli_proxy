# installation instructions

- cert installation
    - double click `fluffiac.crt`
    - click "Install Certificate..."

    - select "Current User"
    - click "Next"

    - select "Place all certificates in the following store"
    - browse, and select "Trusted Root Certification Authorities"
    - click "Next"

    - click "Finish"

    - read and understand the security warning.
    note: the tldr of the warning is that your computer will trust certificates issued by fluffiac. this allows
          me to issue https certificates for websites that I do not have ownership over (like e.roli.ga, or the
          url for your bank). it truly does make your device less secure, so don't install anything if this is 
          something that concerns you.

- modify hosts file
    - double click the `hosts` shortcut
    - give notepad admin rights
    - add several new lines to the end of the file

    - on one of the new lines, paste the following:
3.22.67.226	e.roli.ga

    - save the file, and restart your device

- to confirm that the installation worked
    - visit https://e.roli.ga/proxy_status on a non-firefox web browser
    - if you see "proxy OK" then you're good to go
    - if you see an SSL error, you did something incorrectly, and need to restart
