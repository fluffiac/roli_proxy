Prelude
------------------------------------------------
) How does this work?

    When your computer communicates with a website, it has to translate an address
    (like `google.com`) to an IP. This process is called "DNS Resolution", which can
    be overridden. In this case, we want to direct traffic going to `e.roli.ga`, the 
    site used by the "e621 Search" world, to the service that I am hosting at 
    `3.22.67.226`. This is done by editing a file on your system. 

    We also have to install a `Root Certificate Authority`. HTTPS is designed to 
    detect when URLs suddenly stop referring to their correct IPs, which is a very
    very good thing! (someone nasty could point `your-bank.com` to their server!!)
    We want to opt-out of this protection, which is done by installing the `Root CA`.

    Diagram explaining what a `CA` does:

    Note: When you install a `Root CA`, your computer will "blindly" trust any site
    that I (fluffiac) issue certificates for. This means that, if I wanted to, and
    had access to your network, I could trick your computer into thinking that it
    is making a secure connection to any website while being able to read what your 
    computer is doing!! If you're ultra-concerned about your digital privacy, do not
    proceed with the installation!

Jailbreak Installation
------------------------------------------------
) Step 1 - Certificate Installation

    Double click `fluffiac.crt` in File Explorer, a window should pop up. Read the 
    dialouge, then click "Install Certificate".

    Select "Current User", then click "Next".

    Select "Place all certificates in the following store", browse the options, and 
    select "Trusted Root Certification Authorities". Click "Next".

    Click "Finish". You should recieve a security warning. If you read and understood 
    the above note, accept the warning, if not, please be sure you are aware of the 
    security implications of installing a `Root CA`! 

) Step 2 - Host File Modification

    Double click the `hosts` shortcut in File Explorer. Notepad should ask for admin 
    rights. 

    You should see some text already in this file. Read the file to understand what 
    it is doing. Then, add the following line to the end:

3.22.67.226        e.roli.ga

    Save the file.

) Step 3 - Confirmation

    Visit `https://e.roli.ga/jailbreak_status` on a web browser that isn't firefox.

    If you see "Cannot GET /jailbreak_status", then something went wrong while 
    modifying your "Hosts" file, and you should retry that step.

    If you see an SSL error, you probably need to restart your computer, or retry the 
    Certificate Instalation step again.

    If you see "jailbreak OK", then the installation worked! Go crazy! 

Uninstallation
------------------------------------------------
) Step 1 - Certificate Uninstallation

    Type "Manage User Certificates" in the taskbar. Open the first result.

    Navigate to "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" > "Certificates".

    Find "fluffiac :3", right click the entry, then click "Delete". The warning can 
    be safely ignored, this will restore your machine to the state it was before 
    installation.

) Step 2 - Host File Modification

    Double click the `hosts` shortcut in File Explorer. Notepad should ask for admin
    rights. 

    Remove the line that contains `e.roli.ga`. Save the file.

    You may need to restart your device in case any of these configurations were 
    cached. The "e621 Search" world will have its original functionality restored.
